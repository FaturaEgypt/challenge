# Frontend Developer

Hello candidte, 
We would like you to build a web app that displays the trending GIFs on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/), or [Tenor](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation#quickstart)
Users visiting the website should be able to search for GIFs and see a list of results. The user should be able to expand a GIF and see its details (username, rating, anything you think could be relevant).

Users should have a good user experience on desktop, tablet and mobile devices, we don't recommend a specific layout, so pick what you think will be more fit for your users.

This task is pretty open ended in order to leave you some freedom to improve upon the base by focusing on what you like the most.

We strongly encourage you to pick a couple of optional improvements. We suggest the following, however feel free to add up what you think should be there :

- When the user scrolls the page to the bottom, load new GIFs automatically.
- Create a mosaic layout and display a placeholder when GIFs are still loading.
- Show off your animation skills!
- Sort the results by uploaded time and let the user choose if they prefer ascending or descending ordering.
- Let the user favorite GIFs and list their favorites. The users should be able to retrieve their favorite GIFs even after refreshing the page.
- Provide the ultimate user experience: scrolling, searching, fetchingâ€¦ could be optimized for UX.
- Let the user upload a GIF.

### Deliverables
- We expect your delivery on a git repo.
- Deploy your project as well, Netlify, or vercel are free options.
- we require using VueJS or ReactJS (we seek these 2 frameworks now).
- Responsive application, we will test on Desktop, tablets and mobile phones.
- We expect Readme file on the project root telling us about yourself and any additional requirements to run the project.
