# Backend Software Engineer
You are required to build user authentication and authorization service, we require the following:
- service is responsible for authenticate and login users.
- service is responsible for validating whether logged user is permitted to do specific action or not.
- service is resbonsible for loggin users out from the system

You need to think about the following:
 - How you identify and secure user's session (session, jwt).
 - Datastore you need to use.
 - how to keep user's session valid.
 - way to force invalidating sessions.
 - how to strucuture your roles and permissions.
 - how to assign specific user a specific role or permission.

- You may implement your solution with framework, or using vanilla technology.
- You may build RESTful API to expose the essential functionlities in order for other services to consume your service.

We love documentations, at all levels, also we love git, so always deliver you code
in a git repo, with readme.md file descriping how should we get your
code working, you may also include:

- Your thinking process, how you designed your solution.
- Any Diagrams, System diagram, ERD, Draft Drawing, UI Mocks â€¦ you may mobile photo and send it in.
- Any leftouts? what you may added if you got additional time.
- Tell us about something you learned during the coarse of this task.
- Useful link(s) related to you or the task you may like to share with us.
